Question: How has the DALYs changed in the UK over time?
Hypothesis: The DALYs value decrease all the time because of the improvement of the medical level

the answer to my question starts at 49th line

Result: The DALYs value decrease before 2014, and keep stable in the following years.
        This may mean that the medical level of UK has reached the top level since 2014.
